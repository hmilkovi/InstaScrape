## Usage

**There are 4 main actions:** [Login](#login), [Logout](#logout), [Dump](#dump) and [Down](#down).

```
Actions:
  Reminder: You may need to login first.

  {login,logout,dump,down}
    login               Login to Instagram and choose account (cookie)
    logout              Logout from current account
    dump                Dump target data to file or print to stdout
    down                Download media from target(s)

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           show detailed logging messages (level: DEBUG)
  -q, --quiet           suppress logging messages output (level: ERROR)
```

Once you've logged into an account, `InstaScrape` will store its object `InstaScraper` to a pickle file for next time use. 
This means you will not need to log in again the next time you use `$ instascrape ...`, unless you log out.

*NOTE: The `InstaScraper` object is stored in a pickle file in `~/.instascrape/insta.pkl`.*

---

### Login

`$ instascrape login [-u/--username <username> | -c/--cookie <path/to/file>]`

* `-u/--username` : try loading a local cookie with this username, prompt for password if no cookie of this username found
* `-c/--cookie` : provide a cookie file for the login process

Example output, if `-u/--username` and `-c/--cookie` are not specified:
```
    Choose Account

(1)   user1
Last login: Thu Feb  7 20:03:51 2019

(2)   user2
Last login: Thu Feb  7 17:38:36 2019

(x) * user3
Cookie Not Found: deleted from disk

(3) + Login New Account

choice>
```
* `*` asterisk annotated the current logged in user

**NOTE:** In this situation, `user3` is logged in. The `InstaScraper` object is saved and being used by `user3`, but the cookie file is already gone.
That means once `user3` logged out, he will need to provide his credentials again to get a new cookie in order to log into Instagram.

*NOTE: All cookies are stored in the `~/.instascrape/accounts/` directory.*

---

### Logout

`$ instascrape logout [-r/--real]`

* `-r/--real` : send a POST request and delete the local cookie (if found), you will need to provide your credentials again th next time use
* a `fake logout` just removes the `InstaScraper` object (`insta.pkl`) and does not delete the cookie 

---

### Dump

`$ instascrape dump [type] [[flag]...[-c/--count <integer>]] [-o/--outfile <path/to/file>]`

#### Dump Types and Flags

* **User `@username`** : user information in JSON format
  * followers `-followers` : followers of the user in plain text, one username per line in the pattern of `@username`

* **Post `:shortcode`** post information in JSON format
  * likes `-likes` : users who liked the post in plain text, one username per line in the pattern of `@username` 
  * comments `-comments` : comments of the post in JSON format

#### Flag Option

* `--count <integer>` : set maximum count of items you want to get

#### Dump Options

* `-o/--outfile <path/to/file>` : dump data to file in a proper format
